# Testing OpenTV

There is no QA department; there is you, your provider and your telly. This page makes that
count. The app logs everything it does, so a bug report with a log attached is usually a fix
within the day — and a "works for me" without one is usually nothing.

## The quick loop from macOS

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew assembleDebug
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell monkey -p app.opentvmobile.debug 1
```

There is no `test-run.sh` in this repository. `testDebugUnitTest` runs the debug variant's unit
tests, while `assembleDebug` writes the APK to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. To
compile the debug variant and run its lint checks, use:

```bash
./gradlew lintDebug
```

These commands do not replace testing on a device. To validate the work on
`feature/roadmap-1.1`, follow the Spanish
[1.1 manual test plan](MANUAL_TEST_ROADMAP.md), starting with its smoke cases.

## What to test after any change

| # | Check | Pass looks like |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| A | Quality grouping | One row per logical channel; "N qualities" badge on grouped ones |
| B | Guide feeds | Gear → enable a guide for your country → "matched N of M" reported |
| C | Now/Next | Matched channels show programme + progress bar, not "No guide information" |
| D | Playback | Channel plays; quality switch top-right; switching mid-stream keeps playing |
| E | **Wrong matches** | No channel shows another channel's programmes — the worst bug this app can have. Report the exact channel name |
| F | State survives | Favourites/hidden survive a refresh and an app restart |
| G | Fast switching | Holding channel-change never wedges playback (one tune when you stop) |

## Reading the log

Interesting lines and what they mean:

- `Matcher: N of M channels have a working guide` — the headline EPG number.
- `Feed 'X' failed: <reason>` — a guide source failed; the same text shows in Guide settings.
- `Source N: ... channels` — catalogue sync result.
- `AndroidRuntime: FATAL` — a crash; everything above it in the log is the story.

## Reporting

Open a GitHub issue with: device + Android version, what you did (checklist letter is
enough), what happened, and the relevant chunk of `testrun.log`. **Strip your provider's
URL/username/password first** — logs deliberately never print credentials, but check what
you paste anyway.
